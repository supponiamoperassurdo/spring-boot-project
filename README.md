# A web system project
A spring boot project for my exam of web systems design and architectures, at UniPa.

<br/>

Its aim is simple: a web app which allows to everyone who own a credit card (more likely a gift card) to check its balance: if a un user is signed in, he can check all of the card's movement. An admin can create a new gift card, delete a negotiant and disabling/enabling existing cards; instead, a negotiant can sell gift cards to users and check all of the maked transactions.
